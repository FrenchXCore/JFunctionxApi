## Introduction

FunctionX is a decentralized ecosystem relying on the Cosmos ecosystem.

FXCore is the main blockchain ($FX) upon which is relying the PundiX ($PUNDIX) on-chain payment system.

This Java API allows you to interface to a FunctionX mainnet/testnet node in order to use its RPC REST interface (usually on port 1317).

## Quick start

Have a look at the example interface to understand how to use it.

The RestService class includes all the methods available for query on the RPC interface.

## Testing

This library is not yet fully tested. So please be indulgent.

## Useful to know

Some latest functions of the Cosmos SDK are not yet implemented into the FXCore mainnet or testnet nodes (NFTs...) but methods are already provided.

Have fun !
